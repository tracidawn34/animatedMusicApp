# Final Project - JavaScript

## Overview
In this project, you’ll combine all of the skills you've been working on to build a web a custom application that does anything you want! It must meet the project requirements below, but beyond that, feel free to use your creativity to decide on what your app will do.


## User Story
```
AS a developer, 
I want to ensure that my web application meets certain criteria 
SO that I can ensure functionality, usability, and maintainability.
```
### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Wireframe, Design, and Distinct Features**:
   - You must submit a wireframe for the design of your application.
     - Examples of free wireframing tools:
         - http://draw.io/
         - https://figma.com
   - The layout and design of the application must be well thought out
   - The final product must be polished and profesional looking
   - The application must possess at least three distinct features.
      - Example: If it's a travel planning application, one of these features could be the ability for users to create a new trip.

2. **Git Repository**:
   - The repository name should sound professional
   - The project's git history should reflect a minimum of ten commits.
   - The project must include a `README.md` file.
   - The `README.md` should provide a clear explanation of the project's purpose and instructions on how to use it.
   - The project should be hosted and accessible via GitHub pages.


3. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - The application should be fully responsive on mobile devices.
   - The application should be fully responsive on different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, laptop).

4. **Coding Best Practices**:
   - Code should be indented properly.
   - There should be no instances of unnecessary code repetition.
   - Variables should follow the camelCase naming convention.
   - Code should be well documented through comments

## Recommendations

1. Start out by creating your project’s foundation in HTML.
2. Frequently make commits in git to save your progress.
3. Build one piece of Javascript functionality at a time, testing each change you make with `console.log`.
4. Keep your code meticulously organized as you go.
5. Use proper indentation, whitespace, and comments.
6. Try to write a function for each separate piece of functionality that exists in your code. This will make your code “modular” and easier to build off of.
7. If you find yourself repeating code, think about how you could use either a loop or a new function to eliminate the repetition.
